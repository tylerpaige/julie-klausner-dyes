# Julie Klausner Dyes custom theme

This theme is built off Shopify's Color Block theme. It is customized in a number of ways:

**Restyles typography**

This theme is customized to use a type scale, where a base font size is mulitplied by an exponential number. The base font size can then be scaled up and down, and the hierarchies are preserved. The client can change the scale or the base font size via the "customize" menu.

As such, many elements have had their class names changed to use our type presets.

Additionally, this theme uses two custom fonts that are not available through Shopify: DIN Condensed (served via Adobe Fonts) and YoungSerif (via a file uploaded to Shopify, served through Shopify's CDN). Since these fonts are custom, they override any values the client may select in the theme's customization. 

**Replaces color schemes**

The original theme did not allow enough flexibility with its color schemes. This derivative theme allows the user to craft 4 color schemes, each of which contains a foreground and background. This will allow the client a greater degree of choice when styling the site.

These color schemes are designed to be selected from a palete designed for the client.

**Replaces icons**

This theme comes with customized icons for the menu, search, and cart. They are simple and are intended to match the logo's styling.

**Increases max-width on logo**

Since the logo is typographic, we increase the maximum allowed size to get it to match nicely with our type scale.

**Accommodations for inventory is always one-of-a-kind**

All products sold on this site will be one of a kind. Therefore, we don't expose any "quantity controls" for the user to order multiple items: neither on the product page nor in the cart. As a result the cart is somewhat reskinned to avoid redundant information.

NOTE: this does present some usability problems. Hypothetically, a user could "add to cart" twice. After which they would be unable to decrease the quantity. I don't think we should fix this until it becomes a problem. Users can always remove the entire line item from their cart to fix the problem themselves.

**Collections are manually sortable**

This theme prominently Shopify only allows us to sort collections by properties that are natively on that model. Namely, this is title, number of products, and date last modified. It does not work with custom metafields, because of a limitation of how Liquid's `sort` function works.

The client would like more control over the ordering. To do this, we must used Javascript and a `priority` metafield on the Collection model.

**Removed translations**

Since the above customizations affect the configuration schema — and since I don't know have the capacity to translate those new inputs, I have removed all localizations that aren't English.

Dawn represents a HTML-first, JavaScript-only-as-needed approach to theme development. It's Shopify's first source available theme with performance, flexibility, and [Online Store 2.0 features](https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/shopify-online-store) built-in and acts as a reference for building Shopify themes.

* **Web-native in its purest form:** Themes run on the [evergreen web](https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/evergreen-web/). We leverage the latest web browsers to their fullest, while maintaining support for the older ones through progressive enhancement—not polyfills.
* **Lean, fast, and reliable:** Functionality and design defaults to “no” until it meets this requirement. Code ships on quality. Themes must be built with purpose. They shouldn’t support each and every feature in Shopify.
* **JavaScript not required, fails gracefully:** We extract every bit of speed and functionality out of HTTP, semantic HTML, and CSS before writing our first line of JavaScript. JavaScript can only be used to progressively enhance features.
* **Server-rendered:** HTML must be rendered by Shopify servers using Liquid. Business logic and platform primitives such as translations and money formatting don’t belong on the client. Async and on-demand rendering of parts of the page is OK, but we do it sparingly as a progressive enhancement.
* **Functional, not pixel-perfect:** The Web doesn’t require each page to be rendered pixel-perfect by each browser engine. Using semantic markup, progressive enhancement, and clever design, we ensure that themes remain functional regardless of the browser.

You can find a more detailed version of our theme code principles in the [contribution guide](https://github.com/Shopify/dawn/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#theme-code-principles).

## Getting started

We recommend using Dawn as a starting point for theme development. [Learn more on Shopify.dev](https://shopify.dev/themes/getting-started/create). 

> If you're building a theme for the Shopify Theme Store, then you can use Dawn as a starting point. However, the theme that you submit needs to be [substantively different from Dawn](https://shopify.dev/themes/store/requirements#uniqueness) so that it provides added value for merchants. Learn about the [ways that you can use Dawn](https://shopify.dev/themes/tools/dawn#ways-to-use-dawn).

## Staying up to date with Dawn changes

Say you're building a new theme off Dawn but you still want to be able to pull in the latest changes, you can add a remote `upstream` pointing to this Dawn repository.

1. Navigate to your local theme folder.
2. Verify the list of remotes and validate that you have both an `origin` and `upstream`:
```sh
git remote -v
```
3. If you don't see an `upstream`, you can add one that points to Shopify's Dawn repository:
```sh
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Shopify/dawn.git
```
4. Pull in the latest Dawn changes into your repository:
```sh
git fetch upstream
git pull upstream main
```

## Developer tools

There are a number of really useful tools that the Shopify Themes team uses during development. Dawn is already set up to work with these tools.

### Shopify CLI

[Shopify CLI](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-cli) helps you build Shopify themes faster and is used to automate and enhance your local development workflow. It comes bundled with a suite of commands for developing Shopify themes—everything from working with themes on a Shopify store (e.g. creating, publishing, deleting themes) or launching a development server for local theme development.

You can follow this [quick start guide for theme developers](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-cli#quick-start-guide-for-theme-developers) to get started.

### Theme Check

We recommend using [Theme Check](https://github.com/shopify/theme-check) as a way to validate and lint your Shopify themes.

We've added Theme Check to Dawn's [list of VS Code extensions](/.vscode/extensions.json) so if you're using Visual Studio Code as your code editor of choice, you'll be prompted to install the [Theme Check VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shopify.theme-check-vscode) extension upon opening VS Code after you've forked and cloned Dawn.

You can also run it from a terminal with the following Shopify CLI command:

```bash
shopify theme check
```

### Continuous Integration

Dawn uses [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to maintain the quality of the theme. [This is a starting point](https://github.com/Shopify/dawn/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml) and what we suggest to use in order to ensure you're building better themes. Feel free to build off of it!

#### Shopify/lighthouse-ci-action

We love fast websites! Which is why we created [Shopify/lighthouse-ci-action](https://github.com/Shopify/lighthouse-ci-action). This runs a series of [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) audits for the home, product and collections pages on a store to ensure code that gets added doesn't degrade storefront performance over time.

#### Shopify/theme-check-action

Dawn runs [Theme Check](#Theme-Check) on every commit via [Shopify/theme-check-action](https://github.com/Shopify/theme-check-action).

## Contributing

Want to make commerce better for everyone by contributing to Dawn? We'd love your help! Please read our [contributing guide](https://github.com/Shopify/dawn/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn about our development process, how to propose bug fixes and improvements, and how to build for Dawn.

## Code of conduct

All developers who wish to contribute through code or issues, please first read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Shopify/dawn/blob/main/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Theme Store submission

The [Shopify Theme Store](https://themes.shopify.com/) is the place where Shopify merchants find the themes that they'll use to showcase and support their business. As a theme partner, you can create themes for the Shopify Theme Store and reach an international audience of an ever-growing number of entrepreneurs.

Ensure that you follow the list of [theme store requirements](https://shopify.dev/themes/store/requirements) if you're interested in becoming a [Shopify Theme Partner](https://themes.shopify.com/services/themes/guidelines) and building themes for the Shopify platform.
